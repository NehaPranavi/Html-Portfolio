        <h3>RRR:</h3>
        <p>
            RRR Is not just a film it’s an emotion through which we 
            Indians can relate This is the truth how the britishers were
            so Garth with the Indians and how much struggle we have done‼️And the 
            way the movie was presented with a package of emotion.

        <h3>Spyder:</h3>
        <p>
            Excellent theme for conveying the message of Humanity!!! 
            I was just completely dumbfounded with that message at the end 
            as I had absolutely NO CLUE of what Mr. A.R.Murugadoss was up to throughout 
            the movie. Though there were some logical mishaps he made sure that to NAIL 
            HIS MESSAGE into everyone's heart so DEEPLY.
